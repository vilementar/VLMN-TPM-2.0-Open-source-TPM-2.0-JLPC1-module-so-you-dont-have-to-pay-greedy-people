VLMN TPM 2.0 – Open‑source JLPC1 module

The schematic is open‑source, but I’m publishing only the design because I want people to actually learn something from it (KiCad isn’t hard!).

At the same time, I also offer ready‑made modules for 65 PLN, with shipping from Poland via Vinted, other platforms, or directly through a carrier. The price is negotiable, but in my opinion it’s already very low.
